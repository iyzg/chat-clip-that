## Chat Clip That!

Silly little project that was really an exercise for me to see how far I could push Cursor AI (an IDE that deeply integrates AI). When ran, it'll show you a live feed of your video and when the keyword is activated "chat, clip that", it'll make a video clip of the previous 15 seconds.

To get this code working, you should install the requirements and get a .ppn file from Picovoice's wake word detection service.
