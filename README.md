## Chat Clip That!

![](https://github.com/iyzg/chat-clip-that/blob/main/fun.mp4)

Silly little project that was really an exercise for me to see how far I could push Cursor AI (an IDE that deeply integrates AI). When ran, it'll show you a live feed of your video and when the keyword is activated "chat, clip that", it'll make a video clip of the previous 15 seconds.

To get this code working, you should install the requirements and get a .ppn file from Picovoice's wake word detection service. Name your file `keyword.ppn` and then use the keyword that you trained for the model.
